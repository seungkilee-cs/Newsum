# 2025-10-02 Fixes and Improvements

## Overview
- **Reason**: Address immediate stability issues discovered during architecture review and improve resilience of ingestion and frontend routing.

## Changes
- **Removed redundant JSON middleware** (`backend/app.js`)
  - Eliminated `body-parser` dependency since `express.json()` already handles JSON parsing, reducing duplicate processing and dependencies.
- **Aligned scraper ingestion endpoint** (`scraper/scraper.py`)
  - Updated POST target to `/api/articles/mongo-receive` (or `/receive` for in-memory flow) to match Express routing, restoring scraper-to-backend compatibility.
- **Improved carousel resilience** (`frontend/src/components/CarouselView.jsx`)
  - Added URL-based site resolution using `getSelectedSiteFromURL` so deep links work without pre-selected state.
  - Display `publishDate` fallback when `date` is missing, preventing blank metadata.
  - Tracks active site locally to provide clear messaging when no articles exist.

## Follow-ups
- Harden error handling and retries in `scraper/scraper.py` for network failures.
- Add authentication endpoints and password hashing in backend controllers.
- Gate debug logging utilities on environment to avoid noisy production output.
